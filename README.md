This is a warmup game for PyWeek. The design is as follows.

Space Bear Cathedrals
=====================

Lead a colony of bears, build cathedrals and fly through space.

Build
-----

Basically you play Tetris in an infinite area with a finite number of blocks. But when you press Enter you shift the block closer to the camera, leaving the previous plane of construction behind. Thus you build a 3D space cathedral one cross-section at a time.

Your goal is to build a closed container this way, with as much hollow inside as you can. You can turn the creation into liquid any time if you want to start over.

Fly
---

Once you have a sealed vessel the pack of bears takes off. You fly around in space, liquefy debris and suck up the liquid. Once the container is filled up, the cathedral heads home. It is ready to be rebuilt bigger and better. The color of the debris you collect naturally affects the color of the liquid and the blocks that you will get in the building phase.

Extra
-----
Also collect components such as thrusters, spikes and cannons in space. These drop at random times in the building phase and their placement will affect your flight for better or worse. Also there are things worth shooting in space.
